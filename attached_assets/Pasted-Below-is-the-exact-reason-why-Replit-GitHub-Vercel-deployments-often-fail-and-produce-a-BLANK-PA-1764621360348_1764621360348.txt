Below is the exact reason why Replit → GitHub → Vercel deployments often fail and produce a BLANK PAGE, and how to fix it quickly.

I’ll explain clearly and give you a step-by-step fix you can do in 2–5 minutes.

✅ WHY YOUR REPLIT EXPORT DOES NOT LOAD ON VERCEL

Replit exports do NOT follow Vercel’s required structure.
When you export a Replit project to GitHub:

1. Replit puts everything inside a sub-folder

Your real code is often inside folders like:

/app
/src
/main.py
/server.js
/frontend/


Vercel then builds the wrong folder → which results in:

✔ Build "successful"
❌ But output contains NO app code

So Vercel deploys an empty site → blank screen.

2. Replit includes files that break Vercel builds

Replit export contains files like:

.replit

replit.nix

package-lock.json without matching package.json

Wrong "main" entry

Wrong start script

Missing "build" script

Vercel tries to guess the framework and fails → blank site.

3. Replit projects use ports / servers Vercel does NOT support

Replit apps usually expect:

to run on a PORT

or run a Node server like server.js

But Vercel serverless hosting does NOT allow arbitrary Node servers unless you configure an API route.

So Vercel builds but does not serve your app.

🔥 FIX — DO THIS TO MAKE aitrading-wheat.vercel.app LOAD PROPERLY
✅ STEP 1 — Fix the PROJECT ROOT on Vercel

Go to:

Vercel → Project → Settings → General → Root Directory

Set this to the folder where your REAL code is.

For example, if your repo looks like:

/
  replit.nix
  package.json  ❌ maybe empty
  app/          ✔ REAL code


Change Root directory to:

app


Then redeploy.

✅ STEP 2 — Fix package.json

Open your repo and check package.json.

Replit export often makes:

no "build" script

wrong "main"

wrong "start" script

references to replit-run or node server.js ← breaks Vercel

Replace scripts with this if frontend React/Vite:
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}


If it is not Vite but plain React (CRA):

{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
}


If Next.js:

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}

✅ STEP 3 — If it’s a SPA (React/Vite), ADD HOMEPAGE

Blank screen on Vercel is caused by wrong asset paths.

Add this to package.json:

"homepage": "."

✅ STEP 4 — DELETE these Replit files (Vercel breaks on them)

Delete from GitHub repo:

.replit
replit.nix
poetry.lock (if Python project)
requirements.txt (if unused)


These confuse Vercel’s autodetection.
